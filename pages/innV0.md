	- ## What We Do

	- ### Our Approach
	- #### Focus on "Low Hanging Fruit"
	  
	  We specialize in identifying opportunities that are easy to implement and can have a big impact. Often, these come from using existing and accessible technologies like artificial intelligence and other digital tools.
	- #### The Pareto Principle in Innovation
	  
	  With 20% of the effort, you can achieve 80% of the potential value. Your company likely has several obvious improvement opportunities that can significantly enhance efficiency or better meet customer needs through new technologies and tools.
	- ## How We Do It
	  
	  Our agile and simple methodology is based on three elements:
	- Video conference sessions with the team responsible for the area to be improved.
	- Structured work between sessions, where we apply customized analytical tools and frameworks.
	- Final report with key insights, including current situation diagnosis, project viability, technology recommendations, necessary process changes, and an action plan proposal.
	- ### Version 0 Program
	  
	  As a first step, we propose participating in our Version 0 Program. It's an agile intervention that requires only a few hours from the team involved. The goal is to analyze a specific improvement idea and provide:
	- A quick validation of its viability
	- Clear recommendations on what to do next
	- Possible implementation paths: with your internal team, hiring external support, or a combination of both
	- ## Common Use Cases
	- Improve current processes and increase efficiency
	- Detect new product or service lines
	- Incorporate emerging technologies in an agile way
	- Start doing things that were previously unfeasible
